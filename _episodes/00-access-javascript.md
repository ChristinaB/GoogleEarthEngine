## Getting Approved as a Trusted Tester

In order to use Google Earth Engine, you need to sign up for the platform and be approved as a trusted tester. Use the steps below to sign up.

### Directions:

Go the the [GEE sign up page](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/) and select the email you want to use for your GEE account. A gmail is best if you have one.

On the next page, enter in the information requested about your email, your affiliation, etc. Where it asks what you want to accomplish, make sure you mentioned you are at Geohackweek at the University of Washington.

Check your email, including your spam folder in the next few days to look for a link from the Google Developer's Team. The confirmation email will have directions on how to access the Code Editor.

Not sure if you have access? Use [this link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) to check. If you didn't get access you will get an authorization error that says your account isn't registered when you click on the link and try to sign in. If you do have access, the link will open up the Javascript API. You can use this link in the future to get into the JavaScript API.

## Javascript Tips

JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language often used in web development alongside HTML and CSS. Google Earth Engine can also be accessed through a JavaScript API, which is what we are using at GeoHack.

JavaScript uses camelCase. JavaScript (according to W3 academy) is easy to learn. Like other programming languages, you can use style guides to learn how to write standard, reproducible (marketable!) code.

For in-depth industry guidance, Google publishes their own definitive [JavaScript style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

Dana Tomlin has also created a short [JavaScript Quick Start Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3H1GYZLzLKCckwwVjZfVmdPNDA/view) which only takes a few minutes to work through but hits some of the basics. You can find it by going to the GEE homepage, clicking on the EDU tab in the upper left, and scrolling down to the Geospatial Software Design Exercises section.
