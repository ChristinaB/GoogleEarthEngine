## Closing Thoughts

In this tutorial, you learned
- a basic overview of GEE
- how to navigate the code editor
- how to load imagery
- how to reduce images through both time and space
- how to classify imagery for different land uses
- how to interactively plot a time series

Google Earth Engine was designed with a disciplinary scientist in mind (that's you!). Don't hesitate to dig into the documentation, start discussions on the forum, suggest datasets and give feedback along the way.
