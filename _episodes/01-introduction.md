## What is Google Earth Engine & why do I want to use it?

#### **Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis that brings Google's massive computational capabilities to bear on a variety of high-impact societal issues including deforestation, drought, disaster, disease, food security, water management, climate monitoring and environmental protection.**  - [Gorelick et al., 2017](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900)
