# Google Earth Engine

These are files to build a github website hosting the [geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io/ghw2017) Google Earth Engine [tutorial](https://geohackweek.github.io/GoogleEarthEngine). Github automatically renders these files using Ruby to build the website.

Pull-requests to expand on our tutorial content are encouraged. Changes can be made to the markdown files located in the [episodes folder](https://github.com/geohackweek/GoogleEarthEngine/tree/gh-pages/_episodes)
